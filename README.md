# ABMI Bird Models

## Overview

The Alberta Biodiversity Monitoring Institute (ABMI) has developed a set of models for landbird species in Alberta. This repository contains code to source raw data, wrangle those data, fit models, evaluate the models, and package them for use. Future versions of this repository will also contain a bookdown document describing how data was collected, processed, and analysed. Readers can find the most up-to-date results on the [ABMI Biodiversity Browser](https://www.abmi.ca/home/data-analytics/biobrowser-home).

## Acknowledgements

Data used in the ABMI bird models comes from a variety of sources including academic partners, industry partners, and community scientists from the [North American Breeding Bird Survey](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/bird-surveys/landbird/north-american-breeding/overview.html) and [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) (eBird Basic Dataset. Version: EBD_relOct-2022. Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, New York. Oct 2022). In particular, we would like to acknowledge the contributions of Dr. Erin Bayne, the [Bioacoustic Unit](https://abmi.ca/abmi-home/working-together/projects-collaborations/bioacoustic-unit#), and the [Boreal Avian Modelling Centre](https://borealbirds.ca/). We would also like to acknowledge that this work would not be possible without the dedication of the ABMI staff, both past and present.  Without our field staff, geospatial experts, taxonomists, and ecologists, we would not be able to perform this work.
